# My Solutions to ADVENTOFCODE2018

Just the repo with my work-in-progress for AdventOfCode2018. Not competing, just learning/improving my Python proficiency.
DISCLAIMER: I'm not a profesional coder/developer. Coding is not my day job, but have always enjoyed any good coding/intellectual challenge, so why not? :)
